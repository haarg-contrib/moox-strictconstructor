Revision history for {{$dist->name}}

{{$NEXT}}

        - Switched from Carp::confess to die in order to avoid leaking
          sensitive data via stack traces. The previous behavior can be
          enabled in an application by using Carp::Always.

        - Undo the previous "fix" for the minimum perl version.
          The basic requirement is for 5.004 but the tests require
          5.006.

0.009     2018-03-24 14:12:47-07:00 America/Los_Angeles

        - Built using current Dist::Zilla, so various things
          are better, e.g. includes a LICENSE.
        - A couple of things that are only used in xt tests
          used to be test requirements, now their develop
          requirements.
        - No longer includes explicit dependencies on a handful
          of modules (e.g. indirect) that Moo's use of strictures
          used to require.
        - Now only includes a Makefile.PL.
        - The build now includes a cpanfile in the repo.
        - The minimum perl version is now consistent between the
          Makefile.PL and the META.{yml,json} files.

        - give [even] more explicit credit for code snippets copied

          (MooX::InsideOut) packages.
